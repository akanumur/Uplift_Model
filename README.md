Maximizing the incremental return of your marketing campaigns

It is very important to understand bringing the maximum return for a given budget/time/effort.

1. Customers who are going to buy you your product even without any promotional campaign. (Control Responders)
2. Customers that will not purchase if they donâ€™t receive an offer (Control Non Responders)
3. Customers who won't purchase irrespective of the offer (Treatment Non Responsders)
4. Customers that will purchase only if they receive an offer (Treatment Responsders)

The target customers is obvious from above segments. Our target should be the Treatment Responsders as they need a nudge to buy the product.

2- We will calculate the uplift score. Uplift score formula is:
